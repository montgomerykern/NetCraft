# Stackable modal

Stackable modal is a library for modal dialogs which can be stacked by using z-index position. 
The component uses bootstrap for styling the modal but DOES NOT include it by default - 
you need to import it yourself.

When you open a second dialog the first one is scaled to 0.9 and position behind. You have always 3 visible modals.
